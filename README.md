# ObjectTracking

1. train_model
   - training model that predict the position of object at very next frame.
2. train_model_10
   - training model that predict the position of object at 10 frame after.
3. inference_model
   - print the performance of model that predicts very next frame using iou between predict value and ground truth.
4. inference_model_10
   - print the performance of model that predicts after 10 frame using iou between predict value and ground truth.
5. test_model
   - making a final object tracking video.
